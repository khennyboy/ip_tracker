<!--   
      &&modules in javascript:
    1.Modules are reusable piece of code that encapsulates 
    implementation details
    2. usually a standalone file, but it doesn't have to be
    3. modules are small building blocks tha we put together 
        to build complex application
    4. Modules allows us to easily reuse the same code, even across
    multiple project
    5. In modules , 'this' is always undefined but in script, 
        'this' point to the window object....
    6. modules can import and export and are always hoisted
        and need to happen at top-level
    7. Modules stored in file, exactly one module per file.
